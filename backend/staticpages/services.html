Barnard's Star is a very low-mass star in the constellation Ophiuchus. In 1916, American astronomer E. E. Barnard measured its proper motion to 10.3 arcseconds per year, which remains the largest known proper motion of any star relative to the Sun. Lying at a distance of about 1.8 parsecs or 5.96 light-years, Barnard's Star is the nearest star in Ophiuchus, the second closest known star system to the Sun, and the fourth closest known individual star after the three
