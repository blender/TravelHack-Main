Google Accounts is a unified sign-in system that gives you access to:

    Free Google products, including iGoogle, Gmail, Google Groups, Picasa, Web History, and more.
    AdWords and Google Checkout.

If you've used any of these products before, you already have a Google Account. To try new Google products, simply sign in with your existing Google Account. Your account username is the email address you entered when you created your Google Account. If you use Gmail, sign in with your Gmail username.

If you don't have a Google Account, you can create one now.

A note about Gmail: When you sign up for Gmail, you get a Google Account that gives you access to all of the Google products mentioned above. Just enter your Gmail username and password when you're asked to sign in. Although creating a Google Account won't automatically give you Gmail, you can add Gmail to your existing account at any time. Gmail won't replace your current email address; however, it will become your primary address on your Google Account.
